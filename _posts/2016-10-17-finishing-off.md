    <td> I learnt that during the time that it took to finish the booklet, i was learning all of it at the same time and little bits of it all built up to the final piece. I also learnt that by looking at what work you are set to do, it isn't actually as hard as it might seem. Such as the last piece, it was really long with lots of words and numbers, but eventually we did do it.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was i still got distracted easily. But this was for a different reason. The reason was that the people next to us had done less work than we had, but they got to do their blog once they had "finished". So, they had no homework for i.t. The reason for this is because they didnâ€™t do the last activity in the booklet.</td>

    <td>  Next time, i am not sure what we are doing after half term but, if we are carrying on and we get to make our own, i will make sure that our communication is solid, use more logical thinking, swap every 5-10 minutes and finally check that i have typed the right thing. The thing that will improve my learning most, is to concentrate on my own work instead of someone else's.</td>

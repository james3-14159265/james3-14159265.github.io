    <td> I learnt that during the time that it took to finish the booklet, i was building up my knowledge to the last stage, the robot. I also learnt that by looking at your work and checking it, at sometimes, can be really useful, as i am almost guaranteed to make mistakes during the lesson. A good example for this is a couple of stages before the robot, when we had to alter the spacing between the line and the code. At first i didn't get it right and got really annoyed at myself, but when i went back and checked, i knew that checking my work was the problem.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was, like i said in what i learnt, was my ability to go back on my work and check what i was doing was right. I really need to work on my habit of going back and checking my work. This, i think is the most important habit i need to workon. This is because this will help me in other subjects and everyday life as well as I.T.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>  Next time, i will make sure that i go back and check my work. I will improve my learning by paying more attention of what is going on and to CHECK MY WORK. Next time i will read the instructions clearly, because the reason of why we hadnâ€™t got our robot up and running was because it started in the wrong position.</td>

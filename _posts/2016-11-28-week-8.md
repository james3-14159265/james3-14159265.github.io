    <td>   Today i learnt to control the robot and record what we were doing on film. So, the thing that was effective was that we team up with Tommy (his partner wasn't in) and do a joint effort video, post it on youtube and link it to my blog. In the making of the film, me and tommy were controlling the robots and will was filming.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>  The thing that limited my learning was a physical factor:my arm. You would be amazed with how little you can actually do with your left hand anyway, we need to work on remembering how to set the robot up so we don't waste valuable time trying to figure out how to do it again. So i need to work on my memory, so i record what is going on and use that information to save time next week. </td>

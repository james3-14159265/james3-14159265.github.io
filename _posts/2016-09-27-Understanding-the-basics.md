    <td> I learnt that  the last word, end is very important because once or twice during the lesson i didn't put it in so it came up with and error and i realise that if i keep making this mistake in future then it will completely ruin my program. Also i learnt that with the "end" if you put it in midway through and then run your program to check it's working, then carry on programming and forget to cut it out. Then it takes around 5 minutes to work out the problem and extinguish it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>  The only thing that limited my learning was that habit of either not using the “end” at all or just using it a bit too much. I also need to work on my typing because i made 1 or 2 mistakes which yet again took 5 minutes to sort out but apart from that i did alright.</td>

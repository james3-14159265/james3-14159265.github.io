    <td> I learned that all the emails i was getting from github, that i ignored were actually useful, they were pointing out that my github had a page built faliure. This meaning that my version of github was a bit out of date and the program had changed which meant that mine couldn't be read by the program. I thought that the most effective strategy was just to start again. So, i went through my folders, deleted them and created a new account, overriding my original one.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> The thing that limited my learning was the fact that i was unaware of where my partner. So, what happened was i got up from my place to go and sit next to him and then he moved again so by the end of the lesson it was like a game of musical chairs, i moved places four times throughout the lesson. Although i did do the classwork, i would have been more efficient if me and my partner agreed a place to sit together and just get on with the work.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try and use the small amount of wisdom and logical thinking i have gained through this lesson and apply it to future lessons to help my learning. I will improve my learning by asking my partner whether we both know what we are going to do and confirm it. So this will sort out the seating plan and where abouts we can be to each others assistance and where we can just concentrate and heads down to doing some hard work. </td>

 In today's lesson we were working with excel again to create a virtual shop where u put in what you want to buy out of the products available. Then u put in how much/ how many of that product you want. It calculates the price of the product you chose, then how much it would cost all together to buy that amount of the product. Then after you have chosen what you want, how ,much of it you want, how much it would cost individually for that product(s), it calculates the total amount of money it would cost. It kept coming up with na so to get rid of this and make it look better and more presentable we had to just add iferror to the code. So it looked like this =IFERROR((F9*G9), Â£0.00).

    <td>    This week, i learned by reading the question probably, and this way i was able to do more exercises on codecademy, this was my target from last week. I was able to use this strategy because the last lesson I was stuck on a exercise but I read the question a few times and got through it. So, the most effective strategy today was to read what the example said and use it in my work.</td>

    <td>   The thing that limited my learning this week was making stupid mistakes like forgetting to put a colon at the end of a line of code. I think i have already had this as a mistake before so clearly it needs to be worked on.</td>

    <td>    I learned by just doing the work. Finishing off what I started last week. There actually wasn't really much. All we did was figure out how to decode it. So I did that by copy and pasting the lines of letters again but in a different order so the first would be second and the second would be first. Then just repeat the code for the first set of letters and you've got your decoding.</td>

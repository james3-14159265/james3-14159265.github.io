    <td>    At the beginning i was a bit stuck on this one question but it was fine as others were stuck on it to so i could hear what they were doing wrong which is surprisingly what i was doing wrong and edit my work so it works. This is not cheating, just using my brain which, is, goodâ€¦ The most effective strategy i found was to do the easy sections of pyglatin first, before coming back to the harder ones.</td>

    <td>  What limited my learning this week was that i wasn't concentrating enough on the work we were supposed to be doing so eventually our teacher had to come over and tell us to be quiet and get on with what we were supposed to be doing. So i need to work on using my brain a bit more to tell me: "we are in I.T. we are supposed to be doing codecademy, not talking about how shocking liverpool are."</td>

    <td>  Next time i will change my brain. Only joking. I will change my attitude to learning and think logically, in I.T. we do I.T. I will improve my learning by doing the work we were set and doing the easier ones first before coming back to the harder ones. </td>

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

Today I learnt by just tackling the task that was presented in front of me. I read the instructions given and tackled writing the code. This seemed to be an effective way to get through the code because I did 7% worth of work today and usually I only do about 5% each week. This is good progress and I will use this technique next time.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Something that limited my learning was talking and giving up. Firstly, I would talk to the people around me because I had done one very bad thing, GIVE UP. The only reason I talked was because I had given up because I couldn't do the code.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I have two main targets to work on for my next lessons. They are to not give up because giving up leads on to my next target, talking. When I give up I talk because I have lost interest in the code. So, for next time I will not give up because it means I won't talk. Also, I will not give other people the answers because that is cheating. Read one of my last blogs to find out about cheating.

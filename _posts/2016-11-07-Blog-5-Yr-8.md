Starting Point: To follow the booklet.

Target for this lesson: To complete the book.

Did I reach my target? Yes, me and my partner finished the book.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

I learnt by reading the code I had to write out. Then I would copy it out onto my computer fuze box. I would then check that it was correct and then would save it. Once I had saved it I would move onto my next piece of code and do the same.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Something that limited my learning was getting distracted. This was in my last blog and I still haven't stopped doing it. That is something I need to work on. Also, I forgot to add capitals and spaces which means when I check it I have to spend time changing it.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

Next time, to improve my learning I will try to not get distracted as I said in the last paragraph. Also if I typed quicker I would get a lot more work done which would be helpful. If I got work done quicker we would get through the booklet quicker.

 Me and my partner finished the book today so now we are on the robotic arm!

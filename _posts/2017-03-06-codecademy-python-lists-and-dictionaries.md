    <td>    This week, i learned by reading the question probably, and this way i was able to do more exercises on codecademy, this was my target from last week. I was able to use this strategy because the last lesson I was stuck on a exercise but I read the question a few times and got through it.</td>

    <td>  What limited my learning this week was not noticing stuff. This week, i spent most of the lesson trying to find what was wrong with my code and in the end it was as simple as a spelling mistake. I wrote == instead of just a =. I need to work on noticing things more to save time which could have been used to do more on codecademy.</td>

    <td>  Next time i will look out for small mistakes at the beginning, when i am writing my code and not at the end, to save time and effort. I will improve my learning by reading the question well and not making small annoying little mistakes that could actually end up turning into a big problem.</td>

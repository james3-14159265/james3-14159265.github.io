In today's lesson we looked at our blogs and set targets. First, when we got in, we were told to get up our blogs. Mr Keen walked round and gave us our targets. Mine were:

Add text boxes 

Change background and profile picture from a gif to a still image

Change the colours to match better

After we had written our targets in our planner to improve our blog page, we looked at our codecademy work. I was 19% through and that seemed to be about the average in the class. After looking at our blogs and our codecademy work we did exercises on codecademy to improve more. That took up the next part of the lesson. I went from 19% to 20% which is about 5 exercises.

My target for the lesson (not for blog) is too put more effort in the exercises I do.

Lesson Review

This blog is not like any of my other blogs. This blog is about something very important. Cheating. Cheating is a big problem that is faced in schools. But, you are probably thinking of a different type of cheating than I am. The cheating in school is different to most cheating. Cheating in school is very common. It happens all the time. But,how is it done?

It is done when a teacher puts a pupil on the spot, and the pupil isn't sure what the answer is. Then, another pupil whispers the answer to them. The person who was asked then tells the teacher the answer and gets lots of praise. This is bad. This is cheating. They do not learn, their brain is worked for them which means they don't learn from it.

It's like if your homework is to do 1 hrs worth of research on WW2. You copy and paste off a website or a friend. You hand it in and your teacher says well done. You have the proof that you have done the work but you haven't actually learnt anything.

This is why ALL cheating in school should be stopped because it is very bad for everyone's learning.

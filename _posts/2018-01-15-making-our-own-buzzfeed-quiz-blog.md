Making our own buzzfeed quiz

 I think the easy way for making a quiz is to have yes/no answers and another option that "randomly" selects yes or no. If the number of yes answers outweigh the number of no answers then the ending answer will be yes. The opposite goes for no. But if the number of yes and no answers are equal or roughly equal then there will be a middle answer. So the best way to do this is probably convert the answers into numbers and do ranges for the final response answer. I will be making my quiz based on how fit you are.

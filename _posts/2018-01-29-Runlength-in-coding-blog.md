**Run Length in coding**

Today we did some run length in coding. At the start of the day I had no idea what it was but as we progressed throughout the lesson I made my understanding a bit clearer of what it was. So run length in coding basically means how many pieces of data you have in one line of coding. So the more different colours and the less patterns you have means the bigger the file would be. To demonstrate this we used excel spreadsheets to create a picture in a box. We used the small boxes as pixels for the picture. I as well as 3 other different people in my row created pretty much the same emoji face and wrote out the coding on a line next to the boxes on different lines.
